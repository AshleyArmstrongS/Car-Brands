# Car Brands DB  
![logo](./assets/images/logo.png) 

This is a website which allows for the storing and displaying and storing of Car Brands and their accompanying Car Models. 
The Site uses a MySql database to store these Car brands and models. These can be added to, updated and deleted using the site. 

## How it works 

The site uses the MVC pattern to access, manipulate and display car information. The use of this pattern allows allows for easy access to mysql statements being able to pass them into the view through the controller. 

The database contains two tables Car_Brands and Car_Models. These store a variety of data and datatypes which can be accessed and manipulated through the view. 

## What can could've been done better 

Given more time i would've liked to have seperated the form error messages from the formUtils page into the controller.
